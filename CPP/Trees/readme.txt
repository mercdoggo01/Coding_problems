// Topmost Node is called root.
// Nodes under a root are called children
// root above children is called parent.
// Nodes with no children are called leaves.




// Binary tree has at most 2 nodes
(i.e 0 , 1 or 2).

// Type of binary trees

0.)Full binary tree
//Every node has zero or two children.

1.) complete binary tree
// all levels are completely filled except last level.
// last level has nodes on lef t side.

2.) perfect binary tree 
//All leaf nodes are at same level.

3.) Balanced binary tree
// height can be max log(n) {base 2}where n is //number of nodes.

Eg.) log(8) = 3

4.)Degenerate tree
// Every node single child.
